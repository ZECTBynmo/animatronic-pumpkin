# Happy Halloween!

This is a web-controlled animatronic pumpkin, with an auto-glare mode (it just looks around wildly and blinks).

You can connect to the web interface, register a controller (I use an XBox controller), and control the pumpkin directly. Joysticks control the eyes, and triggers control the eyelids. Shoulder buttons open the eyes wide in surpirse.

There's also a strip of 8 RGB LEDs inside that change color based on the "mood" you want.
